\title{Plot Model Coefficients}
\usage{
\method{plot}{model}(model_results, models = NULL, group = 20, show_only = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list containing the model results, which must include
a named list of coefficients. Each element of the list should correspond
to a different model.}

\item{models}{Optional vector of model names to display. If NULL, all models
in `model_results` are used. If specified, only coefficients from
these models are plotted.}

\item{group}{The maximum number of coefficients to display per plot. If the
number of coefficients or specified `show_only` indices exceeds this
number, the coefficients will be split across multiple plots.
Defaults to 20. If `group` is greater than 20, it will be set to 20
to maintain plot readability.}

\item{show_only}{Optional numeric vector specifying the indices of the
coefficients to display. This allows for focusing on specific
coefficients. If not NULL, only the specified indices are shown.
If `show_only` contains more indices than `group`, coefficients
will be distributed across multiple plots according to `group`.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying the specified or all coefficients.
        The plot includes options for interactivity, such as zooming
        and panning, if displayed in an interactive R environment.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the coefficients from the provided model results.
It supports selection of specific models to display, grouping of coefficients
for cleaner visualization, and focusing on specific coefficients through
the `show_only` parameter. Coefficients can be grouped into multiple charts
to avoid cluttered plots.

\examples{
# Same data generate process as slab_shrink
set.seed(123)
n <- 100 # Number of observations
p <- 50  # Number of variables
test_x <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
beta <- matrix(rnorm(p + 1), p + 1, 1)
test_y <- cbind(1, test_x) \%*\% beta + rnorm(n, sd = 0.5)

# Fit a model using a fictional slab_shrink function
result <- slab_shrink(test_x, test_y) # Estimation works with just x and y

# Plot the model using default settings
plot.model(result)

# Plot the model for specific models "SR" and "ST"
plot.model(result, models = c("SR", "ST"))

# Plot the model with groups of 15 coefficients each
plot.model(result, group = 15)

# Plot the model showing only specified coefficient indices
plot.model(result, show_only = c(1:12, 30:40, 45:50))

# Expect an error when out-of-range indices are provided in show_only
# This line is meant to show error handling and should cause an error when run
tryCatch({
  plot.model(result, show_only = c(51:60)),
  error = function(e) cat("Expected error for out-of-range show_only: ", e$message, "\n")
